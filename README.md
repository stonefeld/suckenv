# SuckENV

My configurations to get a fully working suckless-based environment.

## Requirements

* `make`
* `gcc`
* `Fantasque Sans Mono`
* `Material Design Icons`

## Building

```bash
$ sudo make install
```

It will build and install all files in `/usr/local/bin`.

You can also build individual components:

```bash
$ sudo make dwm
$ sudo make dmenu
$ sudo make st
```
